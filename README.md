### **Project Overview**
This repository contains R scripts and analyses exploring the **bioethanol production potential** of different agro-waste substrates and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* performance under stress conditions.  
It includes the following analyses:  
1. Proximate composition analysis  
2. Stress tolerance assessment  
3. Correlation studies

#### ðŸ“Š **Proximate Statistical Analysis**  
[R Script](https://github.com/aymunir1/Bioethanol-Study/blob/main/ANOVA%20%2B%20TURKEY%20HSD.R)

Performs **statistical analysis** of proximate composition (*Ash, Moisture, Fibre, Fat, Protein,* and *Carbohydrates*) across **Cornsilk**, **Corncob**, and **Mango Blossom** substrates to evaluate their nutritional potential for **bioethanol production**.

- **ANOVA Test** â€” Determines if significant differences exist among substrates.  
- **Tukey HSD Test** â€” Identifies which substrate pairs differ significantly.  
- **Summary Statistics** â€” Computes Mean Â± SD values per substrate.  
- **Result Formatting** â€” Combines mean, SD, and Tukey letters into a summary table.

#### ðŸ§« **Stress Tolerance of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_**

Evaluates the **stress tolerance** of *S. cerevisiae* under environmental and fermentation stress to understand how key factors affect yeast growth, fermentation efficiency, and ethanol yield.

- **Temperature Tolerance** â€” [R Script]()  
  Assesses yeast performance across different fermentation temperatures.  
- **pH Tolerance** â€” [R Script]()  
  Examines yeast growth and activity under varying pH levels.  
- **Ethanol Tolerance** â€” [R Script]()  
  Investigates the effect of increasing ethanol concentrations on yeast survival and productivity.

#### ðŸ§ª **Correlation Analysis**  
[R Script](https://github.com/aymunir1/Bioethanol-Study/blob/main/Correlation%20and%20Heatmap%20(Temperature%20%26%20pH).R)

Performs **correlation analysis** among key fermentation variables (*temperature, pH, residual sugar, specific gravity, ethanol yield, absorbance,* and *purity*) to identify factors influencing **bioethanol production efficiency**.

- **Temperature Study** â€” Examines how fermentation temperature affects ethanol yield.  
- **pH Study** â€” Explores how pH variation influences fermentation performance and product purity.
