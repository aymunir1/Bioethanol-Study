ðŸ§ª **Correlation Heatmap for Temperature and pH Optimization**
This section performs a correlation analysis among key fermentation variables (e.g., temperature, pH, residual sugar, specific gravity, ethanol yield, absorbance, and purity) to identify relationships that influence bioethanol production efficiency.
It uses Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients and visualizes them using heatmaps generated with the corrplot package:
Temperature Study â€” Examines how fermentation temperature affects ethanol yield and related parameters.
pH Study â€” Explores how pH variation influences fermentation performance and product purity.
The heatmaps use custom color gradients to indicate positive (green) and negative (red) correlations, helping to quickly identify the most influential process variables.
