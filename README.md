📊 **Proximate Statistical Analysis** [R Script](https://github.com/aymunir1/Bioethanol-Study/blob/main/ANOVA%20%2B%20TURKEY%20HSD.R)

Performs **statistical analysis** of proximate composition —  
including **Ash, Moisture, Fibre, Fat, Protein,* and Carbohydrates*  
across *Cornsilk, Corncob,* and *Mango Blossom* substrates.
Evaluates substrates potential for **bioethanol production**.

**Analytical Workflow**
1️⃣ **ANOVA Test** — Determines if significant differences exist among substrates for each parameter.  
2️⃣ **Tukey HSD Test** — Identifies which substrate pairs differ significantly.  
3️⃣ **Summary Statistics** — Computes **Mean ± SD** values per substrate.  
4️⃣ **Result Formatting** — Combines mean, SD, and Tukey group letters into a polished summary table.  



🧪 **Correlation Heatmap for Temperature and pH Optimization** [R Script](https://github.com/aymunir1/Bioethanol-Study/blob/main/Correlation%20and%20Heatmap%20(Temperature%20%26%20pH).R)

This section performs a **correlation analysis** among key fermentation variables —  
including *temperature, pH, residual sugar, specific gravity, ethanol yield, absorbance, and purity —  
to identify relationships that influence bioethanol production efficiency.

📊 **Studies Conducted**
1. **Temperature Study** — Examines how fermentation temperature affects ethanol yield and related process parameters.  
2. **pH Study** — Explores how pH variation influences fermentation performance and product purity.

 🎨 **Visualization**
The correlation heatmaps apply **custom color gradients**:
- 🟢 **Positive correlations** — Indicate strong synergistic relationships between variables.  
- 🔴 **Negative correlations** — Highlight inverse relationships that may reduce process efficiency.
